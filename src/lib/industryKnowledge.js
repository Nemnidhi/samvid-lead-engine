// Industry knowledge bank - one entry per industry. Used to generate
// industry-specific pain-points text, revenue-leak bullets, a before/after
// business-flow diagram, and an outlook line for the report, instead of the
// single generic DEFAULT_PAIN_POINTS / AUTOMATION_FLOW in reportConfig.js.
//
// Add a new industry by following the same shape as any entry below.
// Discipline for any numeric or forward-looking claim: always attach a
// source, and hedge speculative claims explicitly (see generateParagraph.js
// for the same "use only the facts provided" discipline applied to the
// per-lead assessment paragraph).
//
// revenueLeaks are real, industry-standard risk categories (e.g. "stockouts
// of high-demand sizes") sourced from industry research, not fabricated
// numbers about a specific lead. Never turn these into a rupee-figure claim
// about a specific business without real data behind it.
//
// Matching is honest about what we actually measure: the Digital Presence
// Audit only checks website/social/SEO, not internal operations, so pain
// points are tagged against those same gap categories ("website", "social")
// rather than pretending to detect operational issues we have no signal
// for. Many B2B/industrial entries below have NO pain points tagged at all
// - that's not a bug, it's an honest reflection that a missing website
// isn't a business's real problem in, say, chemicals or metals. For those
// industries the pain-points/revenue-leaks section still works (it falls
// back to the first two pain points), but the "digital presence caused
// this" narrative is a weaker fit than for consumer-facing sectors like
// real estate, hospitality, or education. Worth keeping in mind when this
// data is used for report copy.
//
// financialMatrix is reference data, not yet rendered in reports - there's
// no signal today to know which scale tier a given lead actually falls
// into (would need real revenue/employee-count data).
//
// electronics_electricals is INCOMPLETE: the source document is genuinely
// truncated (confirmed by direct XML inspection - it ends mid-sentence).
// Only 4 of 5 pain points exist, the 4th has no revenue leaks, and there is
// no financialMatrix or outlook at all. Left empty/short rather than
// fabricated. Ask for a complete version of that doc before relying on it.
//
// SEGMENTS: an industry is not one business - a real lead is one player at
// one point in the value chain (raw material, manufacturer, wholesaler,
// retailer...), each with genuinely different pain points, flow, and
// margins. textile_apparel is the pilot for a `segments` shape: instead of
// one blended profile, the industry has multiple segment profiles plus a
// shared `outlook` (market-wide growth trend applies regardless of segment).
// Un-piloted industries stay flat (painPoints/currentFlowStages/
// financialMatrix directly on the industry object) - getIndustryProfile()
// below handles both shapes transparently. Add `segments` to another
// industry only once real segment-specific research exists for it - don't
// fabricate a split just to match the pattern.
